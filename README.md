sublimetext3_gcc_builder
========================

gcc c system builder for sublime text 3

allows you to quickly compile and test c programs very useful for tests
gives options to compile with other c files and options to have argvs to be run with the program
seperate config files for each project/ location for c files( all project files have to be in the same folder)

works with xfce-terminal with default config but it will work with gnome-terminal if you change all of  the 'xfce-terminal' to 'gnome-terminal' in the c.sublime-build file

INTRUCTIONS:

place all the files into your ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packaes/User/ folder

run 'build' or use the default key combination 'ctrl+b' to set how you want the program to be compiled ( it also will do an intial compile and run)

you need to run the 'build' command at least once for the project/folder

run 'Run' or use the default key combination 'ctrl+shift+b' to quickly compile and run the program using the your configs
